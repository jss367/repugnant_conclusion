        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the realm of population ethics, a fascinating and complex thought experiment has challenged philosophers for decades: Derek Parfit's Repugnant Conclusion.</p>
        <p>In his book "Reasons and Persons," Parfit presents us with a paradox. Imagine a scenario (Population A) where a large number of people lead lives filled with rich experiences and a high quality of life. Now, compare it to a different scenario (Population Z) where an even larger number of people lead lives barely worth living, but the overall sum of their happiness, due to their sheer number, exceeds that of Population A.</p>
        <p>The Repugnant Conclusion is the unsettling assertion that, according to some ethical theories, Population Z is preferable to Population A. In other words, it suggests that a world with a larger population and a lower quality of life could be seen as better than a world with a smaller population and a higher quality of life, provided that the total amount of happiness or welfare is greater in the larger population.</p>
        <p>This conclusion challenges our intuitions about the value of quality of life versus the quantity of life. It raises important questions about how we should make decisions that could affect the population's size and quality of life, such as policies related to healthcare, environment, and technology.</p>
        <p>In this interactive exploration, you'll face a series of choices between two different populations. As you navigate through these choices, consider what your decisions reveal about your own beliefs and intuitions regarding this complex ethical conundrum.</p>
